Deepfake Detection with ViXNet and EfficientNet-B3
This project provides an efficient and powerful deepfake detection system based on the ViXNet architecture. This implementation replaces the original Xception backbone with a more lightweight EfficientNet-B3, creating a model optimized for performance on resource-constrained devices.

The model is trained on the FaceForensics++ (FF++) dataset and validated for generalization on the Celeb-DF (CeDF) dataset. A clean, modern web application built with Flask allows for easy, real-time inference.

 Key Features
Advanced Dual-Branch Architecture: Combines a patch-based Vision Transformer (ViT-B_16) for global context and an EfficientNet-B3 for local spatial feature extraction.

High-Performance Detection: Achieves ~94% accuracy on the FF++ dataset and demonstrates strong generalization with ~70% accuracy on the challenging Celeb-DF dataset.

Computationally Efficient: Requires only ~1.8B FLOPs for inference, a significant reduction from the 8.4B FLOPs of the original Xception-based model.

Interactive Web Interface: A simple and responsive web app to upload a face image and receive an instant Real or Fake prediction with a confidence score.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

Git

NVIDIA GPU (Recommended for faster inference)

2. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepfake-detection-vixnet.git
cd deepfake-detection-vixnet
3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

On macOS/Linux:

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

Bash

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Download the Pre-trained Model
The trained model file (best_combined_model.pth) is hosted externally due to its size.

Download from: Google Drive Link

Place the downloaded best_combined_model.pth file in the root directory of the project.

‚öôÔ∏è Usage
Running the Web Application
Start the Flask server from the project's root directory:

Bash

python app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4300.

Upload a JPEG or PNG image containing a face.

The model will return a prediction (Real or Fake) along with a confidence score.

Training the Model
The training script is provided in the notebook_for_model.py file. To retrain or fine-tune the model:

Download Datasets: Obtain the FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF datasets from their official sources (see Datasets section).

Update Paths: Modify the notebook to point to the correct paths for your downloaded datasets.

Run Training: Execute the cells in the notebook. Note: Training is a computationally intensive process and requires a powerful NVIDIA GPU.

üß† Model Architecture
This model adapts the ViXNet architecture by integrating EfficientNet-B3 for enhanced efficiency and generalization.

Component	Details
Core Architecture	Adapted from ViXNet, replacing Xception with EfficientNet-B3.
Patch-Based Attention	Splits images into 16x16 patches and uses a 3x3 convolution to generate attention masks for local feature focus.
Global Branch (ViT)	A Vision Transformer (ViT-B_16) with 86M parameters to capture global relationships between image patches.
Spatial Branch (CNN)	An EfficientNet-B3 with 12M parameters to extract global spatial features using MBConv and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules.
Total Parameters	~98 Million
Input	300x300 RGB images of faces, preprocessed with MTCNN.
Output	A single sigmoid output. A score ‚â• 0.5 is classified as Real, and < 0.5 is classified as Fake.
Training Details	Dataset: FaceForensics++, Epochs: 50, Optimizer: Adam, Learning Rate: 1e-4, Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy.
